<h2>NinChat</h2>

<p>
Need to talk to your friends [at work] but facebook's blue upper bar is too noticeable? 
You should learn to chat like a ninja!
</p>

<p>
This is a prototype of a simple browser extension that allows you to override Facebook's interface with any webpage you want, but leaves the chat tabs unchanged and fully operational.

Note: this is a fun project and should not be taking seriously!
